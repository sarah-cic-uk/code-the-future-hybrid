                        Animal Behaviour, Conservation and Engineering. It annoyed me that there was no software out
                        there to help in my fish conservation research so I took a free evening course (much like this
                        one!) to see if it was possible to learn to code and build the software that I needed. Soon
                        after, I met someone from IBM CIC who suggested I apply because I showed enthusiasm and knew
                        enough of the basics - they would teach me everything else I needed to know. I'm now a Managing
                        Developer and Development Lead for two dev teams and I love my job.</p>

                        transitioned into Front-end development and Javascript. Before IBM I worked as an IT Consultant
                        where I was also contract out to IBM as a Java developer for 2 years, but made myself known and
                        was hired by IBM CIC after my contract ended. I graduated from University studying Computer
                        Science for Games, where i learnt a lot more about the gaming industry, but turned more to
                        software as to not sour the tasting of gaming. I'm fairly new to tutoring so will have to help
                        me learn as well but always enjoyed helping an teaching others.</p>

                        worked on a wide range of roles and accounts, working in L2 support, cloud solutions, app
                        development and finally web development since the start of this year. I've had spinkles of

                        like React and Angular. I hope now to try to apply my web development knowledge through

                        quite some time.<br />

                        One day, I started learning code in my free time, which eventually led me to pursue a new career
                        path. I already had more than 10 years of experience in UX/UI design and development when
                        someone from the CIC discovered my online portfolio and suggested that I attend a CIC assessment
                        centre. That was over 7 and a half years ago.<br />

                        Since joining the CIC, I've pushed myself to step out of my comfort zone and learn new
                        technologies, programming languages, and methodologies.<br />

                        Being a part of the CIC community has been an enriching experience for me. The supportive
                        environment fostered by the organisation has created an atmosphere of growth and learning.The
                        presence of highly talented peers has been a source of inspiration and motivation for me to push
                        my limits and achieve my goals. Their expertise, diverse perspectives, and willingness to
                        collaborate have helped me expand my knowledge and skill set.I feel grateful to be a part of the
                        CIC organisation and community, which has enabled me to realise my potential and pursue my
                        aspirations with confidence.</p>

                        working as an Oracle Consultant. I wanted to improve my technical skills and dive into the
                        latest technologies such as Cloud Computing, AI, and full stack development. I received
                        exceptional support from my Dev Practice at CIC which has helped (continuously) accelerate my
                        growth in these areas in a short amount of time. I joined the CTF program to pay it forward,
                        ready to support and inspire others in their own tech journeys.</p>

                      <p class="description">I joined IBM CIC as an Associate Technology Specialist in August 2022.
                        Before this I studied Accounting and Finance and although I enjoyed it, I realised I enjoyed
                        coding a lot more once I did this Code The Future last year. I was encouraged to apply by my
                        then-tutors and went through the process and ended up here! I've come in with basic HTML and CSS
                        knowledge but I am learning more and more everyday</p>

                        (BA)). Before IBM I have worked as an agile BA, a digital transformation BA, a software
                        developer, freelance graphic designer, Associate Lecturer in computing (Human Computer
                        Interaction) and several other computing area. I am also a trained teacher in information
                        technology and secondary computer science which I took on because of my passion to reach out to
                        more girls to join the computing career and technology industry. Currently at IBM, I work as a
                        Senior Business Analyst/Business Architect and I enjoy what I do in IBM and look forward to
                        tutor in trainings like code the future so I could leverage the platform to tutor more girls in
                        computing, debias them of the myth that this industry are for boys only and encourage them to
                        take on computer science / informaton technology as a career.</p>

                      <p class="description">I joined IBM CIC as a Senior Test Specialist in October 2021. Before IBM, I studied computing science and then went further to acquire a Masters degree in Business Systems Analysis and Design with the aim of becoming a Business Analyst. Later I realised I was a very inquisitive and success driven person who always wants things done in the right way, (almost perfect) quality enough to yield success. I took a job at SNC-Lavlin Atkins where I was the sole Test Engineer working on the Heathrow Aviation project and checking to ensure the facial recognition system could actually recognise a passenger’s face. Whilst working on that project, I realised that being a tester wasn’t enough, I needed to learn and understand the backend of a software, which then made me take on the position of QA Automation Engineer at IBM. I am now being taught how to code in Java Language. I have learnt a lot since I joined IBM and the trainings and career progression IBM offers is second to none.</p>
